Once you’ve clicked the link received by email, you’ll be able to access your account and take control of your subscription. </p><p>To modify your subscription, simply scroll down the page. The first button you’ll see is ''<strong>Skip  order</strong>'', which means your next scheduled shipment will be skipped. You can edit the frequency of your orders or manually enter a new date for your next charge, if, for example, you’re going to be away on vacation and want to schedule it for before you leave or after you return, by clicking on ''<strong>Re-schedule</strong>''.</p><p> You can add or remove items in your subscription by clicking ''<strong>Edit</strong>'' on the product you wish to change, but changes will only apply to orders that haven’t been charged and processed yet. </p><p> You can modify your personal or payment information easily at the bottom of your customer portal. If you have a discount count, you can apply it to specific subscription orders by entering your discount code, in the section right under your products.</p><p> If you want to cancel a subscription, you can click on ''<strong>Cancel subscription</strong>'', which is at the bottom of the list — but why would you want to do that?</p>"

We know what you’re thinking: that’s a great deal and you’re wondering how to subscribe. All it takes is opting in and receiving at least 2 shipments. You can change or skip your orders at any time, but if you cancel your subscription before the second shipment has been received, you’ll be charged the regular price. Plus we're giving away free gifts on almost every order!</p>"
